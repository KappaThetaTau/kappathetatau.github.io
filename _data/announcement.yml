  We are the members of the Kappa chapter of Theta Tau at the University of
  Illinois. We renounce the behaviors and language demonstrated in the video
  released from our chapter at Syracuse University. We assure you that this is
  not representative of who we are as a professional engineering fraternity, as
  dedicated students, as future engineers, or as compassionate and caring
  people. Our membership includes, embraces, and respects people from every
  race, religion, gender, preference, identity, and socio-economic background.
  We support the investigation of the chapter by our national officers, and hope
  that this incident can serve as a teaching opportunity for those who would use
  such hateful language in any way.
