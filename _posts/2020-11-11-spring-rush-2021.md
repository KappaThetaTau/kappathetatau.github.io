Theta Tau is the nation's oldest and largest co-ed engineering fraternity. The Kappa Chapter here at UIUC is comprised of bright, passionate engineers with diverse interests who strive to develop skills in and out of the engineering workplace. With a professional, philanthropic, and social emphasis, we offer a wide range of events throughout the year. Come meet our members and fellow classmates at the following online events!

All events will be hosted online for the safety of our rushes and brothers alike. **Please register for rush using the below link and follow our Facebook group for Zoom links and other relevant information.** Mark your calendars, invite your friends, and we look forward to seeing you at the events!
