I hadn't realized how many professional and networking opportunities would present themselves after I joined, including both directly through corporate visits and indirectly through receiving advice and guidance from other brothers. It's especially refreshing to now be able to return the favor as an upperclassmen by providing mentorship to newer brothers and helping them navigate the same academic and career challenges I once faced. Being in Theta Tau has been a rewarding and meaningful part of my college experience."</p>

Whether through professional development events, philanthropy projects for nearby communities, or social gatherings. Being a member of Theta Tau has taught me so much about myself, and I owe it all to the amazing people who have guided me toward becoming my best self, both personally and academically."</p>
