## Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity

The nation’s oldest and foremost Fraternity for Engineers Founded at the
University of Minnesota on October 15, 1904, Theta Tau is the largest (as well
as the oldest) professional fraternity in the field of engineering. Over 28,000
have been initiated over the years. With emphasis on quality and a strong
fraternal bond, the Fraternity has chapters only at ABET accredited schools, and
limits to fifty the number of student members in any one of its chapters across
the nation.

Theta Tau follows carefully a program in the selection and development of its
members that stresses the importance of high professional ethics and exemplary
practices. Within each chapter, the Fraternity stimulates professional activity
and social compatibility; provides a framework for group participation in
campus, community, engineering, and fraternity affairs; and promotes lasting
friendships – a lifetime of brotherhood in an engineering environment.

The Fraternity presents awards for outstanding personal and chapter
achievements. Through visitation from national officers and other alumni, the
stability of each chapter can be maintained. Guidance and publications are
provided by the Central Office to help manage the chapter in a professional
manner. Financial assistance is available through loans for chapter housing and
loans for senior students.
