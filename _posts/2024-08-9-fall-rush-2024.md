            <p style="text-align: left;">"I rushed TT because I wanted to join a community of like-minded people who shared similar as well as different interests as me. I have met many people who are super awesome, talented, and genuine, all with different backgrounds. I have also learned more about professionalism and career development through mentorship and workshops. If I am ever confused about anything or just bored, I can always reach out to different people and lean on them, which I am super grateful about. People really do it all in TT!!"</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">"I chose TT because I attended the first info session my freshmen year and immediately felt a sense of community that I hadn't found anywhere else on campus. I have made some of my very best friends through TT and I've always felt like I belonged in our organization. I have had the privilege of serving in multiple executive board positions and it opened my eyes to just how intelligent, hardworking, and caring every single member of TT is. I cannot truly express just how grateful I am to be a member and to serve as Regent of such an amazing group."</p>

Not only do I feel much more confident in my professional skills, but I also have a huge network of people that I can rely on. Whether it be about study abroad programs, research opportunities, or even which classes to take, being able to learn from other brothers about their experience has been so helpful. Being a part of this community makes being an engineering student so much easier and so much more fun."</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">"Theta Tau brothers are so inspiring in so many different ways. Everyone is incredibly driven, whether it be in an academic interest or a side hobby. It genuinely inspires me to pursue my passions with the same dedication and enthusiasm that I see in my fellow brothers. <br/>Being in Theta Tau also gives you an enormous network of people to reach out to. When I was applying for internships last year, it was super helpful to talk to alumni working at companies I was interested in to hear their thoughts and experiences."</p>
