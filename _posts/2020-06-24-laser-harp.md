## Abstract 

This is a test this is only a test.


## Objective
The objective of this project was to create a musical harp, with laser beams instead of strings. These laser beams, when interrupted, would cause the laser harp to make music, just like a regular harp. 

With Engineering Open House coming up for the year, our goal was to create an interactive project to demonstrate engineering concepts to kids in a fun way. One of our later objectives is to be able to record the voices of children singing, and actually use their voices for the music that comes out of the harp by assigning each child’s voice to a different note.

## Background
Many of us in the fraternity are musicians, this drove us towards a goal of combining our passion for engineering with our passion for music. Building a laser harp requires mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and more. With Theta Tau Project Committee members coming from many different majors, this was a perfect project to combine our experiences inside the classroom towards a tangible project.

### 2) Design Challenges
Choosing an interface for the lasers was tricky, as we wanted them to be sensitive to being “plucked” as well as visible. This led to a design choice of using a low power laser (<5 mW) along with a custom fog machine. The fog machine amplified the visibility of the lasers and the photoresistors were more than sensitive enough to pick up the change in light.
